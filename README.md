Youth are Africa’s greatest asset and make up 37% of the working-age population in Africa.

In 2017, The Africa Competitiveness Report released by the World Economic Forum, the African Development Bank, and the World Bank Group, kicked off with these words: “Looking ahead, the continent’s young and increasing population presents an unprecedented opportunity to spur rapid development, a growing labor force and a large and emerging consumer market hold the promise of significant growth opportunities.

But today, the majority of youth in Africa do not have stable economic opportunities. In Africa, our youth unemployment rate sits at around 60% meaning the vast numbers of its young population are unemployed. Its young people face underemployment and lack of opportunities without access to the internet and the lack of information about any opportunities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to create opportunities for youth, with tremendous potential impact.

Afro-Talanta 911 App aspires to drive positive economic and social growth in Africa by providing a global trusted digital platform through which individuals, organisations and institutions across the world interact and partner with Africa.

Welcome to Afro-Talanta 911 App is a home-grown web-based solution that offers a vital linkage to bridge and narrow the talent gap in Africa. Job seekers use job boards to search for new local and global opportunities.

Afro-Talanta 911 App aims to help an African job seeker to search for new job opportunities in their area and profession from this online job board. Also this is a valuable app for recruiters and hiring managers aiming to attract and find new talent.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
